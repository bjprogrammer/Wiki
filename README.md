# Wiki

Features added
1.) Main Screen - Search widget that consumes wikipedia api to show list of suggestions 
2.) Second screen uses webview to show selected wikipedia page
3.) Added pagination, offline support.

Additionally I have used event bus and broadcast receiver to update ongoing search results (that were incomplete when internet is distrupted) 

Technology Used- RxJava, Retrofit, OkHttp, Glide, Data binding, Event Bus, MVP pattern
